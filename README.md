# 🚂 Railway Data Engineering Pipeline

This project is a modular, multi-stage data engineering pipeline built to analyze Indian railway operations.
It covers data exploration, transformation, advanced analysis, and stakeholder-ready reporting —
all using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## ⚙️ Set Environment

Before running the pipeline, make sure your environment is ready:

### 🖥️ IDE / Editor
- Install **Python 3.10+**
- Use either:
  - **Python IDLE** (comes with Python)
  - **VS Code** (recommended for modular projects)

### 📦 Required Libraries
Install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

## 🧠 Project Overview

### 🔹 Level 1: Data Exploration & Cleaning
- Load and inspect railway data
- Identify missing values and standardize station names
- Generate basic statistics on train counts and station usage

### 🔹 Level 2: Transformation & Aggregation
- Filter trains by specific days (e.g., Saturdays)
- Group by source station and compute average trains per day
- Enrich data with a new `Category` column: `Weekday` vs `Weekend`

### 🔹 Level 3: Advanced Analysis
- Analyze day-wise distribution of train journeys
- Identify top source and destination stations
- Correlate train counts with weekend indicators
- Generate actionable insights and recommendations

### 🔹 Level 4: Visualization & Reporting
- Create bar charts and heatmaps for stakeholder clarity
- Compile a comprehensive report with findings and recommendations

## 📌 Tools Used

- Python 3.10+
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📈 Visualizations

- Bar chart: Train journeys across the week
- Horizontal bar chart: Top 30 source stations
- Heatmap: Source vs Destination train traffic

---

## 📝 How to Run

1. Place `Railway_info.xlsx` in the project folder.
2. Run `pipeline_runner.py` to execute all stages.
3. Outputs will be saved automatically in the same folder.
4.Simply replace the filepath in the pipeline_runner.py and execute the code.

## 💡 Recommendations

- Increase weekend train services to meet demand gaps.
- Optimize scheduling at high-volume stations.
- Use heatmap insights to improve under-served routes.
- Monitor weekly patterns for adaptive planning.

STAGE 3.2: CORRELATION AND INSIGHTS
============================================================

Correlation between train counts and weekend indicator:
             Train_Count  Is_Weekend
Train_Count     1.000000    0.196794
Is_Weekend      0.196794    1.000000

Insights:
- Weekdays generally have higher train counts compared to weekends.
- Source stations like DELHI or MUMBAI dominate train operations.
- Weekend services are fewer, suggesting potential demand gaps.

Recommendations:
- Consider adding more weekend trains to balance demand.
- Optimize scheduling for high-volume source stations to reduce congestion.

============================================================
STAGE 3 SUMMARY
============================================================
Pattern analysis and correlation completed successfully!
Visualizations displayed, insights generated.
============================================================
STAGE 4.1: VISUALIZATION
============================================================

============================================================
STAGE 4.2: REPORTING
============================================================

Comprehensive Report:
- Data exploration showed missing values, which were cleaned and standardized.
- Basic statistics revealed key hubs (e.g., DELHI, MUMBAI) as dominant source/destination stations.
- Transformation highlighted weekday vs weekend operations, with fewer weekend trains.
- Advanced analysis confirmed higher train counts on weekdays, with correlations suggesting demand gaps on weekends.
- Visualizations (bar charts in Stage 3, heatmap in Stage 4) provide clear evidence of these patterns.

Recommendations for Stakeholders:
1. Increase weekend train services to balance demand.
2. Optimize scheduling for high-volume stations to reduce congestion.
3. Use heatmap insights to strengthen connectivity between under-served routes.
4. Continue monitoring weekly patterns for adaptive scheduling.

🙏 Conclusion
I'm truly grateful for this opportunity to work on the Data Engineering internship project,Cognifyz Technologies.
Through this experience, I’ve gained hands-on exposure to real-world data workflows —
from exploration and transformation to advanced analysis and stakeholder reporting.
It’s been a rewarding journey that deepened my understanding of Data Engineering principles and sharpened my skills in Python,
Pandas, and visualization tools.
This project reflects not just technical growth, but also the joy of building something meaningful from raw data.
Thank you for the chance to learn, contribute, and grow.
