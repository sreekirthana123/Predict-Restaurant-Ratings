# Predict-Restaurant-Ratings
This project builds a machine learning regression model to predict restaurant ratings using service and customer-related features. The dataset was cleaned, encoded, and split into training and testing sets. Models were trained and evaluated using MSE and R² to measure prediction accuracy and feature impact.
